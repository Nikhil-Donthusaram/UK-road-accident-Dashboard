# UK Road Accident Analysis Dashboard

This project focuses on analyzing the UK road accident dataset to gain insights into factors affecting road safety and accident severity. The goal is to explore various aspects of road accidents and identify trends and patterns that can inform road safety initiatives and accident prevention strategies.

## Project Overview

The UK Road Accident Analysis Dashboard provides interactive visualizations to explore accident data, focusing on factors such as accident severity, casualties, vehicle types, district performance, and road conditions. Through advanced Power BI visualizations and filters, the dashboard helps identify the key causes and trends that affect road safety.

## Key Features

- **Total Casualties and Average Speed Limit**: Overview of total casualties and the average speed limit across all reported accidents.
- **Police Force Analysis**: Identify which police force has the highest number of reported accidents.
- **District Accident Report**: Analyze districts with more than 1000 reported accidents.
- **Vehicle Types**: Discover which vehicle types are involved in the highest number of accidents.
- **Vehicle and Casualties Relationship**: Explore the relationship between the number of vehicles involved in an accident and the average number of casualties.
- **Accident Trend Analysis**: Visualize the trend of accidents over time (year, quarter, month, and day).
- **Junction Types and Accidents**: Identify junction types that are more commonly associated with accidents.
- **District Impact**: Determine which districts are the most affected by road accidents.
- **Road Surface Condition Impact**: Analyze how road surface conditions affect accident severity.
- **Slicers for Accident Severity and District**: Filter the entire report by accident severity and district to explore specific insights.
